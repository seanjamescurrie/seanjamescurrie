### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student software developer with a background in graphic design.

I'm interested in learning how to use data to communicate ideas, tell stories and make decisions.

Creating interesting data visualisations exposing unique insights to allow for better decision making is something I find interesting.

I hope to be able to make contributions to emerging innovative technology.
