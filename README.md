### Welcome! ðŸ›¸

I'm a student software developer with a background in graphic design.

I'm interested in learning how to use code to solve real-world problems, build innovative and interesting products/systems. collect data to communicate ideas, tell stories and make decisions.

Creating interesting data visualisations that expose unique insights that allow for better decision making is something I find interesting.

I hope I am able to make contributions to emerging innovative technology and encourage anyone with advice or constructive criticism to share it with me.
